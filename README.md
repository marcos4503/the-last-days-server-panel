# About this Software

The Last Days Server Panel is the perfect all-in-one server manager/panel for the Modpack created by me, The Last Days Modpack. In this Modpack, you need to live in a post-apocalyptic world, infested by Zombies and Mutant Creatures. You need to survive, search, steal, kill, build, arm yourself, ally, research, hide, and much, much, much more. The Modpack is basically a mix of Minecraft with RPG elements and survival games like DayZ and Project Zomboid.

Thanks to The Last Days Server Panel, you can easily run a The Last Days Modpack server on your machine. When you open the Panel, it will attempt to search for server files on your computer. If it doesn't find it, it will ask you if you want to download these files, and if you allow it, then it will download all files 100% automatically, without you having to do anything. If there are updates to the Server files, it will let you know. Once the server files are ready, the Panel will switch to the standard interface and allow you to start or stop the server, view real-time performance statistics, server execution details, view logs, send commands, access the server history, commands, access useful commands, and more!

If you want to play The Last Days Modpack, you will need the Modpack Client. You can <a href="https://github.com/marcos4503/the-last-days-launcher" target="_blank">get it here</a>!

That is all! Don't forget to continue reading the rest of the content below to find out everything you need to know!

# How to update your Server (If the Panel warns you about an update)

If Server Panel notifies you that there is an update to your server files, I highly recommend that you update your server files. If you don't do so, players may experience bug issues while playing on your server, or may not be able to connect to your server at all. This happens because The Last Days Modpack Client is automatically updated by the Launcher, and if your Server does not update, then players will have Clients that are incompatible with your Server. To understand how to update your Server files, if the Panel notifies you about an update, follow the steps below...

<b>1.</b> Access the The Last Days launcher repository, and go to the Modpack server files folder. Or just click <a href="https://github.com/marcos4503/the-last-days-launcher/tree/main/Repository-Pages/builded-ready-server-data" target="_blank">this link</a> to go there!

<b>2.</b> Download all ZIP files named "current-server-data.zip.XXX". After downloading them, place them all in a folder on your computer. Once this is done, open the part 1 file ("current-server-data.zip.001") and keep it open.

<b>3.</b> Open the "ServerData" folder which should be next to The Last Days Server Panel executable. Delete the following files or folders from within the "ServerData" folder. But do this with "The Last Days Server Panel" closed.
- config
- defaultconfigs
- libraries
- mods

<b>4.</b> Go back to the ZIP file you opened earlier and extract the following files or folders from within the ZIP into the "ServerData" folder.
- config
- defaultconfigs
- libraries
- mods

(To make sure you're doing everything right, Windows should not display the "file replace" warning!)

<b>5.</b> Now, open The Last Days Server Panel and test if your server is running normally! To further test correctly, try connecting to your server using The Last Days Client.
