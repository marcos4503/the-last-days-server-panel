ATENÇÃO!
O arquivo "spawner_RETIRED.json" é um arquivo "spawner.json" que foi aposentado, pois agora o Spawn dos monstro do Modpack é feito através do mecânismo de Spawn Vanilla, porém gerenciado
através do mod "Spawn Balance Utility". O arquivo "spawner_RETIRED.json" ainda existe aqui para fins de futuras consultas.
Esta versão do arquivo foi aposentada em 13/01/2025.
